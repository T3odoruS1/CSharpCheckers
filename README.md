## Project 

Checkers project

## How much done

For project has a menu system that is currently switched off and it draws a checker board of different sizes in console.

## !NB

I changed my IDE settins that ` Console.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.White `
is really white (Used for white cells).  It may look differentely on your machine. Before changing the settings it was dark gray, so it may look strange.
